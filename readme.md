# What is this?

Just my cool unpaid try to learn NodeJS

I already know some NodeJS, but the things I know were probably not well learned (agile learning was involved) and I'd like to have strong foundation for all NodeJS knowledge since I'm specializing as a Typescript Engineer.

## Typescript engineer?

Hell yeah, I just like this JS superset a lot.
